# Task_Density_Indicator

## HoT Skill - Token Density Indicator

---

##  Overview

This project implements a **Token Density Indicator** to analyze lexical tokens generated during compilation. The objective is to derive a meaningful metric from raw token data to evaluate code complexity and readability.

---

##  Problem Statement

Raw lexical tokens do not directly indicate code maintainability or structural complexity. Therefore, a feature called **Token Density (tokens per line)** is computed to quantify how dense the code is.

---

##  Approach

### 1. Data Processing

* Token counts for each line are stored using arrays
* Input is taken line by line
* Data is processed using loops

---

### 2. Feature Computation

Token Density is calculated using:

**Token Density = Tokens per Line**

---

### 3. Flag Generation

A threshold value is used to classify code:

* Density > 5 → **Token Heavy Code**
* Density ≤ 5 → **Normal Code**

---

### 4. Additional Analysis

* Line-wise token density is displayed
* Helps identify complex lines
* Improves readability analysis

---

##  Implementation Details

**Language Used:** C

**Concepts Used:**

* Arrays
* Loops
* Conditional statements
* Formatted output using `printf()`

---

##  Sample Input

Enter number of lines: 3
Enter tokens in line 1: 4
Enter tokens in line 2: 8
Enter tokens in line 3: 3

---

## 📈 Sample Output

Line    Tokens   Density   Token_Heavy
1       4        4.00      NO
2       8        8.00      YES
3       3        3.00      NO

---

## ⚙️ Threshold Justification

A threshold of **5 tokens per line** is selected based on standard coding practices. Code exceeding this value tends to be dense and harder to read, debug, and maintain.

---

## Real-World Relevance

Token Density can be used in compiler optimization and static code analysis tools to identify complex or poorly structured code. It helps developers improve readability and maintainability.

##  Conclusion

This project demonstrates how raw lexical data can be transformed into meaningful insights using feature engineering and conditional logic. The Token Density metric provides a simple yet effective way to analyze code complexity.
